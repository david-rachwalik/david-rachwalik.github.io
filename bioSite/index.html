                Ben worked with his father on projects since his youth.  They would do construction together, whether it was building a
                cabin or crafting wood arts.  Ben continues drawing upon this knowledge today from general handiwork to gardening.

                A relaxing, simple life is more valuable than chasing money.  That said, a pleasant retirement with financial security
                is a major goal.
