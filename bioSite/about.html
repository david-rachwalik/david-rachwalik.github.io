        <h2>About</h2>

        <p class="intro">
            Ben is a consultant and installation expert at
            <a href="https://www.soundenvironment.com" target="_blank">The Sound Environment</a>
            in Omaha, NE. He holds much appreciation for his coworkers and the relaxed work environment.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of Ben's favorite hobbies are drawing, video games, and biking. He would spend summers as a kid
            swimming in the nearby lake and Platte River and still visits their cabin out there throughout the year.
            He feels equally close to his mom and dad. Ben's favorite season is during autumn. Health and mental
            well-being are what he values most in life; that and his ability to be creative.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ben's most memorable travel experience has been visiting Japan, twice; an amazing place to be for an
            otaku! If he could possess one super-human ability, it would be to shape-shift. His D&D alignment may
            be chaotic good and Hogwarts house is Gryffindor. His greatest hope is that everyone respects each
            other and our planet.
